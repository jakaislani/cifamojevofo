Rosalynn died on November 19, 2023, at age 96.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The hometown sweethearts’ seven-decade relationship saw them travel from their rural roots to the highest office in the land and beyond. Even in their final months together, as Jimmy entered hospice care in February 2023 and Rosalynn eventually joined him, the pair was there to support each another.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Jimmy and Rosalynn came from a Georgia town of 600 people</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Born in 1924—the first president to be born in a hospital—James Earl “Jimmy” Carter Jr. was the eldest of James and Bessie “Lillian” Carter’s four children. James was a successful local businessman, and Lillian worked long hours as a nurse. The Carters raised their family in and around Plains, Georgia, a small town of approximately 600 people at the time of Jimmy’s birth.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Edgar and Allie Smith were neighbors of the Carters, and in the summer of 1927, Lillian helped deliver their first child, Eleanor Rosalynn. Jimmy, then a 3-year-old, and newborn Rosalynn met just a couple days later for the first time. Later, Rosalynn became a close childhood friend of Ruth Carter, Jimmy’s younger sister.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Read Their Biographies</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Like elsewhere in America, the Great Depression hit Plains hard, and the Smiths’ already fragile economic situation worsened when Rosalynn’s father died when she was 13. She began working to support the family alongside her mother, who held a series of jobs, impressing on her daughter the importance of hard work and independence. Despite her workload, Rosalynn was an excellent student, graduating near the top of her high school class and set on attending college, fulfilling her father’s wishes for his children.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Also a good student, Jimmy harbored dreams of moving beyond Plains and, inspired by a maternal uncle who had attended the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, set his sights on a military career.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Jimmy Carter - Mini Biography" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/974992a0-7721-48ad-be0e-bb53c9fcc45e/974992a0-7721-48ad-be0e-bb53c9fcc45e_image.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Jimmy knew he was going to marry Rosalynn after their first date</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Although Rosalynn had known Jimmy all her life, it wasn’t until 1945 that romance blossomed. She was a freshman at Georgia Southwestern College, nearby their hometown. Jimmy, following stints at that same school and the Georgia Institute of Technology, had fulfilled his dream and was entering his final year at Annapolis. The town was proud of their native son, and as Rosalynn would later write, she had taken notice of photos of Carter in his military uniform at his family home.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When Jimmy returned home that summer, he too took notice of the pretty, shy 17-year-old. One night, when plans with another girl fell through, Jimmy spotted his sister and Rosalynn walking down the street and impulsively asked her to the movies, after which the two shared their first kiss. Jimmy was immediately smitten after their first date, telling his mother that he had met his future wife.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The whirlwind courtship continued when they both returned to school, and that winter, Jimmy proposed. Initially concerned about how fast the relationship was moving and wishing to finish college first, Rosalynn said no. But Jimmy persisted, and when Rosalynn visited Annapolis that spring, they became engaged, with Jimmy gifting her a compact engraved with the letters “ILYTG,” an acronym for a Carter family saying “I love you the goodest.” The couple was married at the Plains Methodist Church on July 7, 1946, just weeks after Jimmy’s graduation.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Related Stories</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">The Carters spent their early married years on the move</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Shortly after their wedding, the Carters moved to Norfolk, Virginia, for Jimmy’s first naval assignment, where Rosalynn gave birth to the first of their four children. Subsequent deployments took the family to Hawaii, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts, before they put down roots in New York.</p><img alt="chip, jack, rosalynn, jimmy, and jeff carter sit on and around a couch and look at a book that rosalynn holds" title="The Carter family circa 1950s" width=1024 height=687 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jimmy-carter-and-rosalynn-with-three-children-chip-jack-and-news-photo-1685124502.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>In this circa 1950s photo, Rosalynn and Jimmy Carter are surrounded by their sons (from left) Chip, Jack, and Jeff.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Rosalynn adapted easily to the frequent moves and enjoyed her time as a naval wife. When Jimmy’s father died in 1953, he decided to resign from the Navy and return home to run the family’s interests, including a peanut farm. Rosalynn initially balked, unhappy with the prospect of returning home to Plains. As Jimmy later wrote in a memoir, communication between the two broke down, as Rosalynn “avoided talking to me as much as possible.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She would later describe this period as one of the rockiest in their marriage, saying she believed, “the best part of my life had ended,” as she struggled to find her own role and to put herself on equal footing with her husband. She eventually found both when she began helping Jimmy run the farm, taking over the business’s finances and helping it turn a profit.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Rosalynn played an important role in Jimmy’s political career</h2><img alt="rosalynn carter and jimmy carter sit on a couch and smile widely, she is wearing a floral dress with a campaign button, and he has on a suit" title="Rosalynn Carter and Jimmy Carter in February 1976" width=4538 height=3165 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/-jimmy-carter-and-rosalynn-carter-attend-former-governor-of-georgia-jimmy-carters-fundraiser-for-his-1976-presidential-run-at-royal-coach-inn-atlanta-georgia-february-14-1976-photo-by-rick-diamondgett.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Rosalynn and Jimmy Carter attend an Atlanta fundraiser for his 1976 presidential run on February 14, 1976.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Now settled in Georgia, the couple became involved in the civic and religious communities, with Jimmy teaching Sunday School at a local Baptist Church (a role he continued until 2019). In 1962, he won a seat in the Georgia State Senate, and following an unsuccessful run for Congress, set his sights on the governorship in 1970. Overcoming her shy nature, Rosalynn campaigned tirelessly on her husband’s behalf, crisscrossing the state. Jimmy’s victory saw her take on a new role as Georgia’s first lady, where she began working on causes she championed for the rest of her life, including mental health.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She took to the campaign trail again when Jimmy announced his candidacy for the 1976 presidential election, visiting more than 40 states. When he won, the couple and their youngest child, Amy, moved to the White House, where Rosalynn, breaking with tradition, became a close advisor to her husband.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/us-first-ladies data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="first lady" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">first lady</a>, Rosalynn was the first presidential spouse to have her own office in the East Wing.

So closely aligned were the couple that Jimmy referred to Rosalynn, who he’d nicknamed Rosa, as a “perfect extension of himself.”</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">They continued their work together in the post-presidency years</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Carter’s 1980 reelection defeat was devastating to both Jimmy and Rosalynn. They returned home to Georgia to the modest two-bedroom ranch house in Plains where they’d lived before Carter had scaled the political heights. The couple continued to champion their causes and humanitarian efforts, through both the Carter Center and their work with Habitat for Humanity, through which they built more than 4,000 homes around the world.

They spent their final months together at home. Jimmy, who is 99, began receiving hospice care at home this February, and then 95-year-old Rosalynn’s health was also declining. “They’re just meeting with family right now, but they’re doing it in the best possible way: the two of them together at home,” grandson <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.politico.com/news/2023/05/23/jimmy-carter-hospice-ice-cream-00098480 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jason Carter said" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jason Carter said</a> in May. “Their faith is really grounding in this moment.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The couple did manage to enjoy a few last outings together.
