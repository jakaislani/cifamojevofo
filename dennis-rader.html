However, six separate witnesses came forward and offered testimony asserting Reeves as Garber’s killer. Investigators believe Reeves bound Garber, sexually assaulted her, and overdosed her with drugs. “We had a witness who was terrified in 2010, 2015, 2017, to talk, but eventually, all six sources came forward, without knowing what happened in regards to each individual person,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.kctv5.com/2024/03/21/missouri-cold-case-previously-with-questions-about-possible-btk-connection-closed-suspect-named/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="lead investigator Lori Howard said" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">lead investigator Lori Howard said</a>. “No one knew what the other was saying.

Living a double life as a devoted family and company man by day, Rader brutally murdered 10 people. His nickname represents his method of binding, torturing, and killing victims. He also taunted authorities through brazen correspondence with local news outlets. Rader’s alter ego resurfaced in 2004, and his penchant for leaving clues led to his arrest. He pleaded guilty to the murders the following year and is now serving 10 life sentences in prison.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Dennis Lynn Rader<br>BORN: March 9, 1945<br>BIRTHPLACE: Pittsburg, Kansas<br>SPOUSE: Paula Dietz (1971-2005)<br>CHILDREN: Kerri and Brian<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Pisces</p><h2 data-node-id=11 title="Childhood, Wife, and Children" data-anchor-id=childhood-wife-and-children class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Childhood, Wife, and Children</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Dennis Lynn Rader was born on March 9, 1945, in Pittsburg, Kansas, and grew up in Wichita. The oldest of four sons, he enjoyed a seemingly normal childhood, reportedly masking such disturbing behavior as hanging stray animals.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Rader dropped out of college and joined the U.S. Air Force in the mid-1960s. After returning to Wichita, he worked for an outdoor-supply company for about a year. In 1974, he began a lengthy stint as an employee of ADT Security Services.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1971, he married Paula Dietz, and the couple had two children, a son named Brian in 1975 and a daughter named Kerri in 1978. Brian has stayed out of the public eye, but Kerri wrote a 2019 book titled <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1404108556 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="A Serial Killer’s Daughter: My Story of Hope, Love, and Overcoming" data-vars-ga-product-id=c3b046dd-5248-48db-96f2-ca43bffb4703 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1404108556 data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1404108556 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1404108556 data-affiliate-network='{"id":"c754abb3-3204-4f94-a191-fe83f09385e4","site_id":"73ce8f33-abd8-4d76-b5c7-1c72caf717ce","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$12.17 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=077d5e53-17fa-43c1-ad9f-b6a675e8f3f5 class="body-link product-links css-9lyfaf e1rq56bv0">A Serial Killer’s Daughter: My Story of Hope, Love, and Overcoming</a>, in which she discusses how she learned of her father’s criminal acts and overcame the horror associated with them.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 title="First Victims" data-anchor-id=first-victims class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">First Victims</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On January 15, 1974, Rader strangled four members of the Otero family—Joseph and Julie, along with two of their children Josephine and Joseph Jr.—to death in their Wichita home, before leaving with a watch and a radio. Strangulation and souvenir-taking would become part of Rader’s pattern of criminal behavior. He also left semen at the scene and later said that he derived sexual pleasure from killing. The Oteros’ 15-year-old son, Charlie, came home later that day and discovered the bodies.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Rader struck again a few months later. On April 4, he waited in the apartment of a young woman named Kathryn Bright, before stabbing and strangling her when she returned home. Rader also twice shot her brother, Kevin, though he survived. Kevin later described Rader as an “average-sized guy, bushy mustache, ‘psychotic’ eyes,” according to a TIME magazine article.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Other Infamous Serial Killers</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=19 title="“BTK” Goes Public and More Murders" data-anchor-id=btk-goes-public-and-more-murders class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">“BTK” Goes Public and More Murders</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In October 1974, Rader placed a letter, in which he took responsibility for killing the Oteros, in a public library book. The poorly written note gave authorities some idea of who they were dealing with, and a local newspaper began covering the story. Rader wrote, “It’s hard to control myself. You probably call me ‘psychotic with sexual perversion hang-up.’” He warned that he would strike again, noting, “The code words for me will be bind them, torture them, kill them, B.T.K.” The initials stuck, and the murderer came to be known by variations of the BTK Killer moniker, or simply BTK.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Rader’s next known crimes occurred in 1977. That March, he tied up and strangled Shirley Vian after locking her children in the bathroom. In December, he strangled Nancy Fox in her home and then called the police to report the homicide. Shortly afterward, in January 1978, Rader sent a poem to a local newspaper about the Vian killing. Several weeks later, he sent a letter to a local television station stating that he was responsible for killing Vian, Fox, and another unknown victim. He also made allusions to several other notorious killers, including <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/crime/ted-bundy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ted Bundy" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ted Bundy</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/crime/david-berkowitz data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="David “Son of Sam” Berkowitz" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">David “Son of Sam” Berkowitz</a>.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Dive Deeper</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Despite his cat-and-mouse game with authorities, Rader was reportedly an attentive husband and able to keep the lid on his secret, murderous life. In 1979, Rader graduated from Wichita State University with a degree in administration of justice. Still, he continued to taunt authorities and appeared to be poised to strike again.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In April 1979, Rader waited in an elderly woman’s home but left before she returned. He sent her a letter to let her know that BTK had been there. In an effort to catch him, the authorities released the 1977 recording of his phone call to police, hoping that someone might recognize the voice.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After several years without a known crime, Rader killed his neighbor Marine Hedge on April 27, 1985. Her body was found days later on the side of the road. The following year, he killed Vicki Wegerle in her home. His final known victim, Dolores Davis, was taken from her home on January 19, 1991.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=26 title="Return, Arrest, and Imprisonment" data-anchor-id=return-arrest-and-imprisonment class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Return, Arrest, and Imprisonment</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Over the next several years, BTK dropped off the map as Rader focused on work and family life. He had left ADT in the late 1980s and started working for the Wichita suburb of Park City as a compliance supervisor in 1991. In his new position, Rader was known to be a stickler for the rules. He measured the height of people’s lawns and chased stray animals while toting a tranquilizer gun. According to reports, Rader took pleasure in exerting his limited authority over his neighbors and other members of the community. He was also a Boy Scout troop leader and president of his church council.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With many news stories marking the 30th anniversary of the Otero murders, BTK resurfaced in 2004. Rader sent local media outlets and authorities several letters filled with items related to his crimes, including pictures, a word puzzle, and an outline for the “BTK Story.” He also left packages with clues, including a computer disk that ultimately led authorities to Rader’s church. Investigators also noticed his Jeep on security tapes of some of the package drop-off areas and cemented their case by obtaining a DNA sample from Rader’s daughter.</p><img alt="btk killer dennis rader tugs at his waistband while standing in a wood paneled room, he wears a gray suit with a collared shirt and patterned yellow and brown tie, he has a mustache and large glasses" title=" BTK Killer Dennis Rader in August 2005" width=2505 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dennis-rader-the-admitted-btk-serial-killer-sits-in-court-news-photo-1693240666.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>BTK Killer Dennis Rader in court in August 2005</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Rader was arrested on February 25, 2005, and later charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder. His neighbors and fellow church members were stunned by the news, unable to believe that the man they knew was the serial killer that had haunted the area for so long.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Rader pleaded guilty to all of the charges on June 27, 2005. As part of his plea, he gave the horrifying details of his crimes in court. Many observers noted that he described the gruesome events without any sign of remorse or emotion. Because he committed his crimes before the state’s 1994 reinstatement of the death penalty, Rader was sent to El Dorado Correctional Facility to serve his 10 life sentences.</p><h2 data-node-id=32 title="Gilgo Beach Comparison " data-anchor-id=gilgo-beach-comparison class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Gilgo Beach Comparison</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A series of murders in the Gilgo Beach area of New York’s Long Island drew the attention of an imprisoned Rader.

Using prior evidence, police found that Rader’s employment with ADT coincided with the construction of a bank across the street from the laundromat where Kinney worked. Rader also wrote a journal entry around the time of her disappearance called “Bad Wash Day,” in which he described kidnapping a girl from a laundromat.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.fox23.com/news/btk-in-ok-killer-writes-fox23-a-letter/video_af1a48f9-717c-5ce3-8f06-5a94c3a65913.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="But in a prison letter" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">But in a prison letter</a> written to a Tulsa, Oklahoma, television reporter and shared publicly in October 2023, Rader claimed he doesn’t remember writing the journal entry and that any evidence that might link him to the case is coincidental. “Hell no!” he wrote in response to a question asking if he committed any murders in Oklahoma.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Additionally, police used photographs from Rader’s journals to link him to 22-year-old Shawna Beth Garber, whose body was found in Lanagan, Missouri, in 1990. In one picture, they found a red blanket matching one reported missing with Garber.
