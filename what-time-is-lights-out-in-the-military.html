In basic training, lights out means go to sleep. It does not mean talk to your buddies, study or write a letter home.</span></span><h2>What time is lights out at basic training?</h2>Lights out is generally between 7:30 and 9 p.m. Because of the rigorous training taking place during daylight hours, most soldiers are eager to get to bed. Every soldier is required to take a one- to two-hour guard shift (scheduled by the bay leader or drill instructor) during the night.<h2>How many hours do soldiers sleep?</h2>Most Soldiers report sleeping 6 to 7 hours per night, regardless of duty status. However, nearly 1 in 3 report getting less than 6 hours of sleep on weeknights/duty nights. Soldiers also report getting more sleep on weekend/non-duty nights than on weeknights/duty nights.<h2>What time do US Marines wake up?</h2>Typically, during the week, Marines will wake up between 4:00 and 6:00 A.M. and report to either their squad, unit, platoon, or, occasionally, their battalion, for morning Physical Training (PT). Morning PT can consist of a variety of exercises, depending on who is leading PT that day.<h2>What time is lights out in Navy boot camp?</h2>After that first day, normal days will run from 0600 (6 a.m.), with a loud whistle to awaken all recruits until lights out at 2200 (10 p.m.). Precisely at 10 p.m., lights go out. Even though uniform items at boot camp are issued (free), many items are not.<h2>USMC Boot Camp Day 1 - Waking Up in Marine Corps Boot Camp</h2><p></p><h2>What time do you go to bed in boot camp?</h2>In all the branches' basic training programs, bedtime is usually 2100, or 9 p.m., except during times of special events, such as night exercises. In basic training, lights out means go to sleep.<h2>What do Marines call a bed?</h2>Rack: A bed. Marines are weapons, so they are stored in “racks” instead of sleeping in “beds.”<h2>Do female soldiers sleep around?</h2>Male and female soldiers are expected to sleep cot to cot under large tents that house 50 to 60 people at a time. The women usually curtain off a single-sex section in the back with sheets and ponchos.<h2>How fast do Marines have to run 3 miles?</h2>Males must complete the three-mile run in 28 minutes or less.

MREs are basically instant meals that soldiers get when they're in training or in the field. They're usually super processed, canned, or freeze-dried, and can last around three years.<h2>Can you just quit the Army?</h2>You can't just quit the Army once you are on active duty. You are contractually obligated to remain in service for the period to which you committed. But soldiers are discharged from duty early due to physical or psychological inability to perform duties, for drug abuse, misconduct, and other infractions.<h2>Do you get cell phones in basic training?</h2>There are no cell phones allowed in Basic Training. This is a consistent rule for all of the military branches: Do not expect your service member to be able to call you, text you, or receive your messages when they are in Basic Training.<h2>How many haircuts do you get in basic training?</h2>Haircuts are a rite of passage during military basic training. Almost immediately after arrival, your hair will be cut so short that it almost feels like you were shaved bald (guys only). After the initial haircut, you'll get a trim at least once per week during basic training.<h2>What is a female soldier called?</h2>warrioress. “But when this female soldier triumphed over hundreds of the country's best rifle shooters, she became the first woman to win a particular national shooting title.”<h2>How do female soldiers urinate?</h2>This is not a good idea. You need to stay hydrated to avoid heat illness, bladder infections and kidney stones. The female urinary diversion device (FUDD) allows you to urinate discreetly while standing up or leaning back. You can urinate with minimal undressing - just unbutton your pants.<h2>Can my girlfriend live on base?</h2>For starters, an unmarried couple cannot live on a base outside of certain extenuating circumstances that would have the non-service member defined as a caregiver for the service member's children. As a result, unmarried military couples typically live off-base.<h2>What does pizza box mean in the Marines?</h2>Pizza box: There are three levels of rifle and pistol qualification, and badges are earned depending on the degree of proficiency: Expert, Sharpshooter and the lowest, Marksman. Because of its shape, the Marksman Weapons Qualification Badge is called the pizza box.<h2>What is a wookie in the Marines?</h2>"Wook" is a derogatory term for a female Marine.<h2>What does pork mean in the Marines?</h2>26.
