At 16, she took her first comedy class then began appearing in church comedy shows. By age 22, Tomlinson was performing stand-up regularly, and her once-straitlaced comedy had become edgier. After appearing on Last Comic Standing in 2015, she earned a spot on Conan with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/conan-obrien data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Conan O’Brien" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Conan O’Brien</a>. Tomlinson made her stand-up debut on Netflix in 2018 during a 15-minute set on The Comedy Lineup and has since had three comedy specials on the streaming service. With After Midnight’s January 2024 debut, Tomlinson is the only woman currently hosting a late-night program.</p><h2 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Taylor Elyse Tomlinson<br>BORN: November 4, 1993<br>BIRTHPLACE: Orange County, California<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Scorpio</p><h2 title="Early Life" data-anchor-id=early-life class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Taylor Elyse Tomlinson was born on November 4, 1993, in Orange County, California, to parents Angela Tomlinson, a stay-at-home mom, and Eric Tomlinson, a teacher. Taylor has three younger siblings: Drea, Page, and Brinn. Her mom died of cancer when Taylor was just 8 years old. Her father later remarried.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Taylor grew up in Temecula, California, in a conservative Christian household. She realized early on that she had a gift for comedy. In an interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.wsj.com/articles/taylor-tomlinsons-road-to-stand-up-began-in-barbieland-11654009832 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Wall Street Journal" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Wall Street Journal</a>, Tomlinson shared: “My grandma recently told me I was unintentionally funny when I was little. Apparently I cracked up my family.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Tomlinson took her first comedy class with family-friendly comedian Nazareth at age 16 and began doing comedy shows at churches. At Temecula Valley High School, she studied drama. Tomlinson graduated high school in 2011, then attended California Polytechnic State University for one semester before transferring to Palomar College. After three years of college, she decided to drop out. But her college days offered her the opportunity to perform stand-up more regularly. Bigger stages were soon calling.</p><h2 title="Comedy Career: After Midnight and More" data-anchor-id=comedy-career-after-midnight-and-more class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Comedy Career: After Midnight and More</h2><img alt="michael palascak, taylor tomlinson, and anthony jeselnik stand on a stage smiling, each holds a wireless microphone in one hand" title="Michael Palascak, Taylor Tomlinson, and Anthony Jeselnik on 'Last Comic Standing' in 2015" width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/episode-907-pictured-michael-palascak-taylor-tomlinson-news-photo-1712012314.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>One of Taylor Tomlinson’s first professional breaks was an appearance on Last Comic Standing, alongside Michael Palascak, left, and Anthony Jeselnik.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Tomlinson’s religious upbringing shaped her early comedy. “For the first, like, six years—the first half of my career so far—I was squeakyclean,” she told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.eonline.com/news/1328393/comedian-taylor-tomlinson-shares-why-she-needed-to-find-the-funny-in-her-bipolar-diagnosis data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="E! News" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">E! News</a>. But by age 22, Tomlinson had switched up her material to less church-friendly content that no longer felt authentic to her. She told E! News, “It was hard to get to that place and accept that not everybody was going to love that,” adding that she had to “get over my own internalized guilt and shame about not being, like, a good Christian. Not being Christian at all, really.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After leaving college, she landed a gig on Last Comic Standing followed by an appearance on Conan, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/conan-obrien data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Conan O’Brien" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Conan O’Brien</a>’s late-night show on TBS, when she was 23. That led to a network development deal with ABC Studios for a sitcom, which never made it to air. In 2018, she debuted her comedy on Netflix during a 15-minute set on The Comedy Lineup, a stand-up comedy showcase series that had two seasons on the streaming platform.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">More Late Night Hosts</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Netflix Comedy Specials</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">To date, Tomlinson has released three comedy specials on Netflix.

Her second special was the first time Tomlinson publicly discussed her experience with bipolar disorder. “I had all this shame because when I was a kid, my parents were like, ‘You don’t get on medication. That’s weak. That’s not good for you,’” Tomlinson <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.eonline.com/news/1328393/comedian-taylor-tomlinson-shares-why-she-needed-to-find-the-funny-in-her-bipolar-diagnosis data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told E!

News</a>. “So I think I felt weak for needing that.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Over the years, she has chosen to become more transparent about her bipolar disorder on stage. “I’m a personal comedian, and I talk about what’s going on in my life, and that’s what was going on in my life,” Tomlinson <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/taylor-tomlinson-talks-incorporating-her-bipolar-diagnosis-into-her-act-exclusive-8575470 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told People" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told People</a>. “At first I was like, ‘Oh, I’m not going to share this.’ And then I’m on the road, and I’m like, ‘Nah, maybe I’ll just try one joke about it.’ And then that works, and you’re like, ‘Okay, well, I do have more to say about it.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Tomlinson’s newest special on the streaming platform is <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.netflix.com/title/81685073 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Have It All" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Have It All</a>.
