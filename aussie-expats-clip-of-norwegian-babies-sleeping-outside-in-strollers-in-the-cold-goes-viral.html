Photo / TIkTok, @mrmelk_</p><p>An Aussie man living in Norway has clocked more than 14 million views on a clip that shows about a dozen babies sleeping outside in their strollers in freezing temperatures.</p><p>Olly Bowman, 22, from Sydney, shared the TikTok about a week ago but the “unusual” act continues to attract thousands of comments sparking a conversation about the practice of letting babies nap alone in cold conditions.</p><p>“Another day in Norway, another group of babies left out alone in the cold,” he said in the clip.</p><p>“Look at how many there are,” he continued as he as he showed a bunch of prams lined up. “It helps with their breathing and makes them more independent,” he joked.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>“It’s actually why so many people leave home earlier in Norway than other countries.”</p><p>His clip has been viewed millions of times and attracted over 16,000 comments from many, particularly Americans, in disbelief.</p><p>“This is so wild to me. I dream of knowing my kids are always safe,” one woman wrote.</p><p>“I’ve seen this it’s wild and I’m envious that we live in fear of abduction,” wrote another.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>While the act has left many in shock, others were more familiar with it.</p><p>“My Norwegian neighbour convinced me to do this and my youngest [does] not get sick as often as my oldest,” one mum wrote.</p><p>“They do this so we don’t get cold ever,” said another, while a third added: “As a Scandi baby, it adapts us to the cold too!!”</p><p>It’s not unusual for babies to be left outside to nap in Nordic countries, including Denmark and Finland, according to <a href=#>Insider.</a></p><p>The publication reported that in those places, parents commonly put their babies down for a nap outdoors because babies may get better sleep while being exposed to fresh air.</p><p>In 1926, Icelandic doctor David Thorsteinsson published a pedagogy book that argued parents should let their children sleep outside in their strollers to get fresh air, even in cold weather, to strengthen their immune systems.</p><p>“It’s recommended by our doctors and midwives. Chilly fresh air makes for amazing sleep,” one woman wrote on Olly’s clip. “They’re warm and cozy inside their strollers!”</p><p>“Normal in many daycares in Sweden as well – good for the immune system,” said another.</p><p>Olly<a href=#> recorded a follow up video </a>asking locals in Bislett, Oslo, if they had any worries about leaving their children unattended in strollers after his initial clip raised concerns about their safety.</p><p>“There’s this thing going around that Scandinavian parents feel comfortable leaving their babies outside to sleep alone. I’m just curious on your thoughts,” he asked a few locals.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>“It’s OK. It depends on where you are though. I don’t think anyone would take our babies here (in Oslo) if we parked it outside (a cafe), no problem,” the man told Olly.</p><p>“I know people do that but we haven’t done it. Not in the city centre. I know a lot of prams have been stolen as well, but people don’t steal the prams when there are babies inside of them, but still we don’t want to risk it.”</p><p>Another local said they feel safe leaving their baby in a stroller in the countryside.</p><p>“I could leave her outside for a second or two at a cafe if I’m going inside for a coffee,” a woman said. “But I always want to supervise her, I want to see her and make sure she’s not crying or anything.</p><p>“But she’s a newborn so if she’s a but older I would maybe contemplate leaving her for a bit longer.”</p><p>The rate of kidnapping in Norway is 0.02 per 1,000 residents during a standard year, according to <a href=#>CrimeGrade.org</a>.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>In comparison, a child goes missing or is abducted every 40 seconds in the US.</p><p>Many Americans commented on Olly’s clip saying they would never feel safe enough to do such an act.</p><p>“Babies [are] being left outside for mums to shop and in America we are scared to send any age to school,” one person wrote.</p><p>In January 2020 Danish musician Amalie Bruun went viral when she shared a photo to Instagram of herself and four-month-son exploring their garden.</p><p>Otto was awake in the image, but Bruun shared that her son “sleeps outside most of the time”.</p><p>A woman from Germany said it is a “common act” and has many friends who do it.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>“There’s a saying ‘there’s no such thing as bad weather only bad clothes’, so they just wrap the baby.”</p><p>A 2008 Finnish <a href=#>study</a> found that children “took longer naps outdoors compared with naps taken indoors”.</p><p>However, there is a risk of hypothermia in the cold weather, and experts say it’s critical that children are bundled up properly when outside.</p><p>“A baby’s temperature can drop four times faster than adults, and they can become hypothermic,” Dr Jennifer Shu, a paediatrician in Atlanta, Georgia, told <a href=#>Insider</a> in 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmraqRq7Kte8CuqqyhlWKyubzArapmm5yevW67xWalqKqnmrSqrc1mmZqamZrAbr%2FLnpypoZ6cerDB06ygnZ1dnrtuv9OrpqWklafAbrXNZquhnV2YvK2wjKCmnqtdq7azrctoem5ud2ekm5yRk32QknJ9o5uYsIZ4gYd7fZJw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jill-scott-serves-estranged-husband-restraining-order.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jill Scott Serves Estranged Husband with Restraining Order">&larr;
