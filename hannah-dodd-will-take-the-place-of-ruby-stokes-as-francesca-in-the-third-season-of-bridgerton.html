The series, based on Julia Quinn’s books, follows each member of the titular family in their search for love. After the debut of its second season, the series soon became Netflix’s most-watched English-language TV program, and it is currently gearing up for its third. Here’s everything fans need to know about Hannah Dodd, the series’ new Francesca.</p><h2>Why is Hannah Dodd so well-liked?</h2><p>Hannah Dodd is a model and actress from England. She is well recognized for her work on Find Me in Paris, Eternals, Anatomy of a Scandal, and Enola Holmes 2, as well as Flowers in the Attic: The Origin.&nbsp;Dodd grew up in Leavenheath and was born in Colchester. She began dancing at the age of two and attended Evolution Foundation College before graduating from the London Studio Center in 2017 with a Bachelor of Arts in Theater Dance. She has been a model with Select Model Management since 2011 and has worked with labels such as Topshop and Burberry. Her modeling career started when she was 16 years old.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Hannah-Dodd-1.jpg alt="Hannah Dodd" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Hannah Dodd in Season 3’s Francesca.</h2><p>Hannah Dodd will replace Ruby Stokes as Francesca in the third season of Bridgerton, Netflix revealed in May. In a recent interview with TVLine, the 27-year-old British actress expressed her excitement. She went on to say:</p><p>“Everyone has been extremely kind. All I wanted was to do a decent job. Colin and Penelope’s tale was fantastic. I’m extremely excited to see how it plays out in our version.”</p><p>She also said that she had read six of Quinn’s eight novels in the series, beginning with Francesca’s narrative in order to prepare for her part, explaining:</p><p>“Because I had no idea what I was getting myself into, but I wanted to read it as quickly as possible. It’s such a lovely novel, and she’s such a lovely character. I still can’t believe I got to portray her. I understand how people feel about her, so I’ll try my best.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Hannah-Dodd-3.jpg alt="Hannah Dodd" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to the official Netflix description of Hannah Dodd’s character:</p><p>“Within her gregarious, outgoing family, Francesca Bridgerton is a bit of a mystery. Despite her guarded demeanor, she goes along to get along in society, reinforced with caustic wit and pragmatism that baffle the fickle ton while drawing notice when she least wants it.”</p><h2>Season 3 of Bridgerton on Netflix</h2><p>Bridgerton has been extended for a fourth season as well as a third. Season 3 will also diverge from the book sequence and concentrate on Penelope and Colin’s love story, which was revealed in the fourth novel, Romancing Mister Bridgerton, according to the streaming network.</p><p>In terms of the series cast, most of the characters are likely to return, with the exception of a few key characters whose narratives were handled in the previous two seasons. Producer Shonda Rhimes, on the other hand, claimed that the plot contains eight siblings in all, implying that the series may last for eight seasons or more. Season 3 started production earlier this month and is expected to premiere on Netflix in early 2023. Stream Bridgerton Seasons 1 and 2 on Netflix, and stay tuned for more information on the forthcoming season.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGifmqaelrVusM6dm2avmaG5bsDApJxmrJiaerG4wJycZqeWYr%2B2rthmqq2nm5rAbq3SZp2rmZ6YsrSvwGagp2WknbJuwMeiqZ1lo5qutLvNZqafZZKntqWzxKurqKZf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jason-mraz-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jason Mraz  Bio (Wiki) ">&larr;
