He was one of 12 children born to Michael Jerome Williams Sr. and Denise Oher, who provided their children with little to no support. Michael Sr. was frequently in prison, and Denise was addicted to crack cocaine. As a result, Oher was in-and-out of foster homes and frequently homeless. He also performed poorly as a student, repeating first and second grades and attending 11 different schools during his first nine years as a student.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The young boy was finally taken in by Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy when he was 16, and the Tuohys became Oher’s legal guardians when he was 17. In his junior year, Oher began to excel in football. By the beginning of his senior year, Oher was the starting left tackle on the varsity football team. He quickly became a top football prospect in the state of Tennessee, which led to multiple scholarship offers from Division 1 schools. Off the field that year, Oher’s estranged father was murdered.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Still, Oher experienced great success in 2004. A well-known high school football player, he received first team All-America honors from USA Today and was given the opportunity to play in the U.S. Army All-America Bowl. He accepted a scholarship from the University of Mississippi after receiving offers from Tennessee, Louisiana State University, Alabama, and North Carolina State, among others.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 title="College Football Career" data-anchor-id=college-football-career class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">College Football Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As a freshman offensive lineman at Ole Miss, Oher played 11 games and started 10 of them at the right guard position. Oher was selected first team Freshman All-America by The Sporting News and first team Freshman All-SEC for his play in 2005.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In his sophomore season in 2006, Oher became a breakout star in the highly competitive Southeastern Conference after a move to his more natural position at left tackle. Oher earned second team All-SEC for his performance.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Oher continued to dominate at the left tackle position in his junior year. After being selected as a consensus first team All-SEC in 2007, Oher declared for the 2008 NFL Draft. Two days later, however, he rescinded his declaration for the draft to return for his senior season at University of Mississippi.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Oher was one of the senior leaders on the University of Mississippi team that recorded its first winning record since 2003.

Held in New Orleans, the Super Bowl pitted the Baltimore Ravens against the San Francisco 49ers. Oher and his teammates emerged victorious in the championship in a tight game, scoring 34 points to the 49ers’ 31 points. After his impressive win, Oher told ABC News, “I came so far—from nothing to a Super Bowl championship. I’m in shock right now.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A free agent following the 2014 season when he played for the Tennessee Titans, Oher joined the Carolina Panthers after being recruited by the team’s quarterback <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/cam-newton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cam Newton" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Cam Newton</a>. Oher’s strong performance in 2015 helped Newton win the MVP award and served as a major cog in the team’s run to a berth in Super Bowl 50.

But we’re going to love Michael at 37 just like we loved him at 16.” According to Sean, the only money the family received from the movie was from The Blind Side author Michael Lewis’ share. It amounted to roughly $14,000 each for himself, his wife, their two biological children, and Oher.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As for the conservatorship, Sean said Oher needed to be legally part of the Tuohy family in order for the NCAA to allow him to play football at University of Mississippi. Both Sean and Leigh Anne had graduated from Ole Miss, and Sean was an “active supporter” of the school, which raised concerns for the NCAA. Lawyers told the couple they couldn’t adopt someone over the age of 18, so they pursued a conservatorship instead.
