A wing of B-17 bombers was assigned to attack the facility, but they were going to need some cover: Military officials predicted as many as 40 enemy fighters might be dispatched to confront the bombers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But they were in good hands.
