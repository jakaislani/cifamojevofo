Prices vary from company to company, but on average, Silestone is slightly more expensive than granite.</description></item><item><title>Our Honest Review of the Blue Raspberry Slurpee Drumstick</title><link>/blue-raspberry-slurpee-drumstick-review.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blue-raspberry-slurpee-drumstick-review.html</guid><description>Earlier this month, social media snack-vertiser Markie Devo broke the news to the world that there was a new exclusive Drumstick flavor based on‚Ä¶ a Blue Raspberry Slurpee?
